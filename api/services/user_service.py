# Project Name: Motive Event Management System
# File: user_service.py
# Description: This file defines the service layer for user-related operations within the Event
#              Management System. It encapsulates the business logic for managing users, including
#              establishments, entertainers, and individual users. Key functionalities include
#              creating new users, authenticating users, updating user information, and handling
#              user deletions. This separation of the business logic from the web layer (routes)
#              and data layer (models) allows for a more organized and maintainable codebase.
#
#              Functions in this file interact with the database through the user_model.py
#              to perform operations such as user creation, authentication, and updates, ensuring
#              that user data is correctly managed and stored. Passwords are securely hashed before
#              storage to protect user information.
